- manual selection of vertices
    - only use voxels which have same directionality (sign) across scans
    - then choose the best ones
- make lines
    - load line labels
    - get coordinates orthogonal to line
    - shift according to contrast
    - get coordinates across cortical depth
    - make mesh from pointcloud
- sample data
    - transform coordinates to volume
    - save in array
    - output as overlay for visualization purposes
- analyze
    - line plot
    - fit with gaussian
    - get parameter estimates
